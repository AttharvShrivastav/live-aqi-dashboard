# Live AQI Dashboard for Pithampur

This script fetches and visualizes live air quality forecast data from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) Project API. It is configured to pull data for the Sector-2 Industrial Area monitoring station in Pithampur, India (Station ID: `@10522`).

The script processes the retrieved data using Pandas and generates an interactive time-series chart with Plotly. The final output is a self-contained `dashboard.html` file.

## Features
* **Live Data Integration:** Connects to the WAQI API to get up-to-date daily forecast data.
* **Data Processing:** Uses Pandas to parse the JSON response, clean the data, and structure it for analysis.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Generates a Plotly line chart showing forecasted PM2.5 levels, complete with tooltips and interactive controls.
* **Standalone Export:** Saves the final chart as a single, portable HTML file that can be opened in any web browser.

## Technology Stack
* **Python 3**
* **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the API.
* **pandas**: For all data manipulation and cleaning tasks.
* **plotly**: For creating rich, interactive visualizations.

## Sample Output
The following is an example of the `dashboard.html` file generated by the script.
